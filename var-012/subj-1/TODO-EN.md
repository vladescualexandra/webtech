# Having the class `Shape` complete the following tasks:

- If `Shape` is instantiated directly and the `area` method is called, an `Error` with the message `not implemented` should be thrown; (0.5 pts) 
- A `Square` extending `Shape` should be defined. A `Square` can be instantiated by passing an object with a `width` property; (0.5 pts)
- Given a `Square`, its area should be correctly calculated; (0.5 pts)
- A `Circle` extending `Shape` should be defined. A `Circle` can be instantiated by passing an object with a `radius` property. Given a `Circle`, its area should be calculated correctly; (0.5 pts)
- A `Rectangle` extending `Shape` should be defined. A `Rectangle` can be instantiated by passing an object with a `width` property and a `height` property. Given a `Rectangle`, its area should be calculated correctly;  (0.5 pts)
